Responsive Grids with Garden

Priyatamm Mudivarti

MOTIVATION

- Grid System is an aid

- Many choices: 960x, Bootstrap, Foundation, Jeet, Sysy, Skeleton, Skeljs, Flexbox (50 grid libraries)

- a single grid function create-minimal-grid

- reponsive typography (based on viewport math)

- dynamically inserts css in web page by calling ClojuresCript Functions

- Bootstrap: Container > Row > Column ion markup is limiting

- DIN Paper System (fold in half...)

- Golden FGrid System: A folding grid for responsive design

- Most grid libraries are limited. Need to understand more than colum and rows.

GARDEN

- Everuthing is expressed as DS

- Vectors = Selectors, Maps = Declarations, Rules = Vector of Vectors, Mixins are just defs.

- In SASS, you are recreating language features, not in Garden

- Based on abstractrions over CSS

- Separating Selectors and Declarations: This allows easier specification of combinations by composing themm with HOF.

- Too many global dependencies in CSS. Would like to control a the component level.
